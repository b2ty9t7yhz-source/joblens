# Internship Application Intelligence Tracker

A FastAPI-based backend and web app for tracking internship applications, analyzing job descriptions, recommending resume versions, and prioritizing roles.

## Overview

Students applying to internships often lose track of:

- Which companies they saved or applied to
- Which resume version they used
- Which roles are high priority
- Which skills are missing from a job description
- Which applications need follow-up

This project solves that problem with an application tracker plus job intelligence features.

## Features

### Application Tracking

- Add applications
- View all applications
- View one application
- Update application status
- Delete applications
- Track company, role, link, source, status, deadline, location, notes, and resume version

### Job Intelligence

- Analyze job descriptions
- Detect skills such as Python, SQL, REST API, FastAPI, Docker, AWS, Git, and more
- Identify job family such as Backend, Data, Web / Full Stack, AI / ML, QA, or IT
- Detect role level such as Internship, Entry Level, or Senior
- Calculate match score based on user skills
- Identify matched and missing skills

### Import Workflow

- Paste a job description
- Analyze the role automatically
- Generate notes
- Save the role as an application

### Resume Recommendation

- Compare job descriptions against multiple resume versions
- Recommend the best resume version for a role
- Explain matched and missing skills

### Priority Scoring

- Score roles based on match score, role level, location type, deadline, and missing skills
- Return priority level and action items

### Dashboard

- View total applications
- View saved and applied counts
- View interview count
- View upcoming deadlines
